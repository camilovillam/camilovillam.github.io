# Welcome to My Blog

This is your first blog post! You can write about your experiences, projects, insights, or anything else you'd like to share with your audience.

## Getting Started

This blog post is using a custom blog layout that gives your content a different appearance from your project pages. Feel free to customize the styling in the `_layouts/blog.html` file.

## How to Create More Posts

To add more blog posts, simply create new markdown files in the `blog/_posts/` directory with the naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md
```

For example:
- `2025-12-20-my-second-post.md`
- `2025-12-25-power-platform-tips.md`

## Post Structure

Each post should include:
- **layout**: Set to `blog` to use the custom blog layout
- **title**: The title of your blog post
- **date**: Publication date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
